# Project Communicator Configuration File for the Flags Extension
#
# The file is a basic list of variables "name = value"
#
# Comments start with a # character, must be the first character after spaces
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# DO NOT EDIT
#
# Instead create a file under
#
#    /etc/communicator/communicator.d/50-flags.conf
#    TODO: WARNING: THIS DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK...

# Whenever a flag is raised, it saves a file with the flag data in this
# directory.

#path=/var/lib/communicator/flags

# Default: communicator
#user=communicator


# group=<group name>
#
# The flags are saved under the specified `path` and this parameter defines
